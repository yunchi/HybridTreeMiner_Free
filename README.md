1) The input should be text file in the following format for each transaction:

tid_1

number_of_nodes

node1_label

...

noden_label

edge1_label connect_from_which_node connect_to_which_node

...

edge(n-1)_label connect_from_which_node connect_to_node

2) All transactions are put one after one in the text file. A sample database "example_free.txt" is given. 

3) Usage: HybridTreeMiner_Free support input_file output_file
where support is an integer, i.e., minimal number of occurrence

4) Output file contains the running time, the number of frequent trees for each tree size.
